# 20-20-20
It has been suggested that the 20, 20, 20 rule could be beneficial in reducing the chance of eye-strain caused by computer usage.

The Royal National Institute of Blind People advice is:
"The 20, 20, 20 rule suggests taking a break of at least 20 seconds, every 20 minutes and to look at least 20 feet away."

This is an open source and fully customisable app for Windows 10 which will send a reminder to the user every 20 minutes to help them follow the 20, 20, 20 rule.
